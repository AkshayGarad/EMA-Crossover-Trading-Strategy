# EMA Crossover Trading Strategy

This GitHub README article provides an overview of a simple long-only trading strategy coded in Pine Script using TradingView's //@version=4. The strategy is based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossover, a popular technical analysis tool. It generates buy signals when a shorter-term EMA crosses above a longer-term EMA, and it incorporates a trailing stop to manage risk.

## Strategy Overview

The "S EMA Cross L EMA Strategy (Long Only)" is designed for a bullish market. It uses two EMAs:

- **Short EMA (Blue)**: A faster EMA with a period of 9.
- **Long EMA (Red)**: A slower EMA with a period of 13.

When the short EMA crosses above the long EMA, a buy signal is generated, and a position is opened. Additionally, a trailing stop is applied to manage the position, with a specified stop loss value of 10 ticks (0.10). This strategy aims to capture upward price movements while mitigating potential losses.

## Pine Script Code

```pinescript
//@version=4
strategy("S EMA Cross L EMA Strategy (Long Only)", shorttitle="EMA Crossover", overlay=true)

// Define the EMA lengths
ema_small_length = 9
ema_larg_length = 13

// Calculate the EMAs
ema_small = ema(close, ema_small_length)
ema_larg = ema(close, ema_larg_length)

// Plot the EMAs on the chart
plot(ema_small, color=color.blue, title="Small EMA")
plot(ema_larg, color=color.red, title="Larg EMA")

// Define the conditions for buying (long) and selling
buy_condition = crossover(ema_small, ema_larg)

// Plot buy signals on the chart
plotshape(series=buy_condition, title="Buy Signal", location=location.belowbar, color=color.green, style=shape.triangleup, size=size.small)

// Define the trailing stop and stop loss values
sl_value = 10
trail_value = sl_value  // 0.10 or 10 ticks
stop_loss_value = sl_value  // 0.10 or 10 ticks

// Strategy orders for long positions only
strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, when=buy_condition)

// Add trailing stop for long positions
strategy.exit("Trailing Stop", from_entry="Buy", trail_offset=trail_value, trail_price=trail_value, stop=stop_loss_value)
```
